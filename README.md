# Udemy Website For HTML5, CSS and BootStrap Sections
###### Ideally, the website is designed for matching dogs.

## What I've learnt:
* Google is my best friend
* HTML5 -> structure, lists, images, anchor tags and links, tables, icons, forms.
* CSS -> both internal and external, with a strong preference for the latter. Static vs dynamic positioning, id and classes, selectors priority. 
* BootStrap -> wireframing, navigation bar, grid layout system, containers, buttons, carousels, cards, z-indexing,  debugging.
* UI/UX -> colour theory, typography and fonts, how to manage user attention, user journey map. Accessibility. Responsive web design.
* Mobilefriendly: a useful tool.
* Refactoring is as good as challenging.
